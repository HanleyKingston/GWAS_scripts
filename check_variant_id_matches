# Chooses a random SNP by rsid and checks that chr:pos match for that rsid in the gds and annother file (SNPs)
## Good for checking that manipulations of GDS didn't scramble variants IDs (compair before and after) or checking variant filters before applying to gds

#Run multiple times
variants_gds <- variantInfo(gds)

rand <- SNPs[sample(1:nrow(SNPs),1), "variant.id"]
SNPs[SNPs$variant.id == rand, "pos"] == variants_gds[variants_gds$variant.id == rand, "pos"] & SNPs[SNPs$variant.id == rand, "chr"] == variants_gds[variants_gds$variant.id == rand, "chr"]
